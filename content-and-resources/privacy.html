				<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

				<p>We are committed to respecting privacy and recognize the need for appropriate protection and management of any Personal Data that is shared with us as part of using the Site. As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personal Data” means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information maintained by Salucro, to personally identify an individual.</p>

				<h4>2. Information Collected</h4>

				<p>We may receive or collect Personal Data in the following ways:</p>

				<p><span>2.1. Personal Data You Provide To Us.</span> If you initiate contact with us in any way, register for an event, or sign up to receive updates, you may be required to provide us with certain information that may constitute Personal Data, such as your name, email address, company name, and phone number.</p>

				<p><span>2.2. Information Collected Automatically.</span> Certain information on the Site is collected automatically by means of various software tools. We have a legitimate interest in using such information to assist in log-in, systems administration purposes, information security and abuse prevention, to track user trends, and to analyze the effectiveness of the Site. Alone or in combination with other information, such automatically collected information may constitute Personal Data. Some of our service providers (described below) may use cookies or other methods to gather information regarding your use of the Site. Such third parties may use these cookies or other tracking methods for their own purposes by relating information about your use of the Site with any of your Personal Data that they may have. The use of such information by a third party depends on the privacy policy of that third party.</p>

				<p>The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (“IP”) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (“ISP”), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, clicked pages and any other information your browser may send to us. We may also use web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about your usage of the Site and interaction with emails from us. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular site tied to the web beacon. For example, we may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify us when you click on a link in the email that directs you to the Site. We may use web beacons to operate and improve the Site and email communications.</p>

				<p>We use cookies to make interactions with the Site easy and meaningful. When you visit the Site, our servers may send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your web browser. We may use cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. Please note that if you disable your web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Site, but you may not be able to successfully use all of the features of the Site.</p>

				<ul>
					<li><span>Strictly necessary cookies.</span> These are cookies that are required for the operation of our websites and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Site will not then work. These cookies do not store any Personal Data.</li>
					<li><span>Analytical/performance cookies.</span> They allow us to recognize and count the number of website visitors and to see how visitors move around our websites when they are using them.

				<p>The use of third-party cookies is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. You may visit the third-party links below to opt out of their tracking and learn about their privacy practices. However, we are not in control of the location of the instructions and information provided by the third parties below and, therefore, you may have to locate the particular instructions and information for the respective third party if these links are no longer current.</p>

				<h4>3. The Purposes For Which We Use Personal Data</h4>

				<p>If you submit or we collect Personal Data through the Site, then such Personal Data may be used in the following ways: (i) to provide, analyze, administer, and improve the Site and services; (ii) to contact you in connection with the Site and certain services, notifications, events, programs or offerings that you may have registered for; (iii) to send you updates and promotional materials that you have registered for; (iv) to identify and authenticate your access to the parts of the Site (e.g., client portals and extranet) and services that you are authorized to access; (vi) for customer service and support; (v) to provide notifications to customers or users of other Salucro web properties; and (vii) to protect our rights and/or our property and to ensure the technical functionality and security of the Site.</p>

				<h4>4. How We Disclose Personal Data</h4>

				<p>We do not sell, lease, rent or otherwise disclose the Personal Data collected from the Site to third parties unless otherwise stated below or with your consent.</p>

				<p><span>4.1. Our Third-Party Providers.</span> We transfer or provide access to Personal Data to our third-party service providers to perform tasks on our behalf and to assist us in providing the Site. For example, we employ service providers who analyze website traffic and demographics; enable sharing of content; and conduct marketing services. We use commercially reasonable efforts to only engage or interact with third party service providers and partners that post a privacy policy governing their processing of Personal Data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will comply with applicable laws regarding Personal Data transfers.</p>

				<p><span>4.2. In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Change of Control.</span> We may transfer or assign this Privacy Policy and any Personal Data to a third-party entity that acquires or is merged with as part of a merger, acquisition, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our shares and/or assets, in connection with bankruptcy proceedings, reorganization, or other change of control.</p>

				<p><span>4.3. Other Disclosures.</span> We may disclose Personal Data about you if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; (ii) enforce our terms of use, including investigations of potential violations thereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues; or (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Salucro, our users, or the public.</p>

				<h4>5. Retention of Personal Data</h4>

				<p>We reserve the right to retain any Personal Data as long as the Personal Data is needed to: (i) fulfill the purposes that are described in in this Privacy Policy (including, The Purposes For Which We Use Personal Data), and (ii) comply with applicable law. We will take all reasonable steps to destroy, or erase from our systems, all Personal Data which is no longer required for the purposes for which the Personal Data was collected.</p>

				<h4>6. Data Security</h4>

				<p>The security of Personal Data is important to us. We take appropriate technical and organizational data security measures against unlawful or unauthorized processing of Personal Data, and against the accidental loss of, or damage to, Personal data. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Further, while we attempt to ensure the integrity and security of Personal Data, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-parties such as so-called hackers from illegally obtaining access to Personal Data. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

				<h4>7. Children’s Privacy</h4>

				<p>We do not intend to collect Personal Data from anyone we know to be a child under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not use the Site.</p>
