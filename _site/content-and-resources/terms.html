				<p>Use of the Site is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including without limitation this paragraph. Any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to Salucro must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises. Salucro’s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify any provision of these Terms. Salucro may assign its rights and duties under these Terms to any party at any time without notice to you.</p>

				<p>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship exists between you and Salucro as a result of these Terms or use of the Site.

				<p>If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms will continue in effect.</p>
