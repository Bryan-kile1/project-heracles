					<li>As a condition of your use of the Service, you will not use  the Service for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these terms and conditions.  You may not use the Service in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden,  or impair the Service, or network, connected to the Service, or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Service.

					<li>The Service may present links to retailers and/or other third-party  websites not owned or operated by Mobivity. These links are provided only as  a convenience to you.

				</ol>

				<h3>4. Price and Delivery</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>The price of any Content purchased through the Service will  be the price specified in the Service at the time of your purchase. By purchasing  the Content or Service you warrant that you are the authorized purchaser and that  the billing information provided is accurate. Mobivity will not issue refunds  based upon inaccuracies represented by the purchaser. By approving the purchase  of the product, you authorize Mobivity to charge you for the purchase.</li>
					<li>Member Subscription: This Service may require you to open an  account. You must complete the registration process by providing Mobivity with  current, complete and accurate information as prompted by the applicable registration  form. You then will choose a password and a username. You are entirely responsible  for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you  are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account.  You agree to notify Mobivity immediately of any unauthorized use of your account  or any other breach of security. Mobivity will not be liable for any loss that  you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either  with or without your knowledge. However, you could be held liable for losses incurred  by Mobivity or another party due to someone else using your account or password.  The Service subscription is not transferable, such that you may not authorize other  persons to use your account. Any distribution by you of your account name and password  may result in cancellation of your subscription without refund and additional  charges based upon unauthorized use.</li>
					<li>Delivery: Delivery of Product(s) purchased pursuant to these  Terms will be made directly to your cellular phone. The details of the delivery  process will be provided to you at the time of purchase. Delivery is conditional.  In order for proper delivery, your cellular phone must be turned on; capable of  receiving the Product(s); set to receive text messages (Please note that not all  mobile phones allow the storage of new ringtones). Ordered Product(s) can only be  delivered when the cellular phone is on a compatible network, a full list of which  is available on the order form. Provided that the cellular phone and cellular phone  provider’s network will accept the Product(s), delivery of the Product will  occur within 24 hours of completion of the order. Typically, delivery of the Product(s)  occurs within a matter of seconds. We will attempt to deliver the ordered Products  a total of three times to the same cellular phone. If the Product(s) has not been  successfully delivered, please notify us within 7 days. If you do not notify us within this period, we will presume that the Product(s) has been received. If the  Product(s) cannot be delivered, Mobivity will refund the payment, provided that  the Product’s non-delivery to the cellular phone is not the result of the  Purchaser’s error. If the Purchaser’s error caused the non-delivery,  payment will not be refunded.</li>
					<li>Mobivity reserves its right to collect applicable taxes and  impose premium surcharges for certain features of the Service.</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>5. Restrictions</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>You may not use the Service to upload, post, transmit, display,  perform or otherwise make available to other subscribers, members or third-parties  any messages, content or materials that are illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory  or invasive of privacy; violate (intentionally or unintentionally) a contractual,  fiduciary or confidentiality obligation or duty you have to any third party; infringe  intellectual property or other third-party rights; harm minors in any way; comprise or contain software viruses or other computer code designed to interfere with the  functionality of any computer systems, software or hardware; interfere with or disrupt  the Service or any networks or servers connected to or by the Service; constitute  unsolicited bulk email, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters,  pyramid schemes, mass mailings, or any form of spam; or violate (intentionally or  unintentionally) any applicable local, state, national or international law. In  addition, you may not use a false email address, impersonate any person or entity  (including but not limited to other subscribers, members and employees of Mobivity,  its affiliates or licensors), or otherwise mislead other subscribers, members or  third parties as to your identity or to the origin of a message or content. You  understand and agree that any loss or damage of any kind that occurs as a result  of the use of any messages, content or material that you upload, post, transmit,  display or otherwise make available through your use of the Service is solely your  responsibility.</li>

					<li>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL MOBIVITY AND/OR ITS AGENTS,  EMPLOYEES, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, BUSINESS PARTNERS AND/OR  SUPPLIERS (“MOBIVITY PARTIES”) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT,  SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED  TO, DAMAGES FOR THE INABILITY TO USE THE CONTENT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS,  BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR THE LIKE), ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE,  THE CONTENT AND BASED ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH  OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF  MOBIVITY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH  DAMAGES AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL  PURPOSE.</li>

					<li>THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY ARE INTENDED TO APPLY  TO ALL ASPECTS OF THIS AGREEMENT.</li>
					<li>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL MOBIVITY AND/OR THE MOBIVITY  PARTIES, AS APPLICABLE, BE LIABLE FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THE SERVICE AND/OR THE CONTENT.</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>9. Miscellaneous</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Remedies. You understand and agree that any unauthorized use  of the Service or the Content would result in irreparable injury to Mobivity  and/or its affiliates or licensors for which money damages would be inadequate, and in such event Mobivity its affiliates and/or licensors, as applicable, shall  have the right, in addition to other remedies available at law and in equity, to  immediate injunctive relief against you. Nothing contained in this paragraph or  elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to limit remedies or relief available  pursuant to statutory or other claims that Mobivity, its affiliates and/or licensors  may have under separate legal authority, including but not limited to, any claim  for intellectual property infringement.</li>
					<li>Promotions and Advertising. Mobivity and/or its business  partners may present advertisements and promotional materials on or through the  Service. Your participation in any Mobivity promotional event is subject to the  terms and conditions associated with that event. Your correspondence or business  dealings with, or participation in promotions of, any third-party advertisers on  or through the Service, including payment and delivery of related goods or services,  and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such  dealings, are solely between you and such third-party. You agree that neither Mobivity  nor its business partners shall be responsible or liable for any loss or damage  of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result of the  presence of such third parties on the Service.</li>
					<li>This Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the  State of Nevada, without giving effect to principles of conflict of laws. You hereby  consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state courts sitting in Clark  County, Nevada or the United States Federal District for the District of Nevada  to resolve any disputes arising under this Agreement. In each case this Agreement  shall be construed and enforced without regard to the United Nations Convention  on the International Sale of Goods.</li>
					<li>This Agreement contains the complete Agreement between the parties  with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous  Agreements or understandings, whether oral or written. You agree that any varying  or additional terms contained in any purchase order or other written notification  or document issued by you in relation to the Content licensed here under shall be  of no effect. The failure or delay of Mobivity to exercise any of its rights  under this Agreement or upon any breach of this Agreement shall not be deemed a  waiver of those rights or of the breach.</li>
					<li>No Mobivity dealer, distributor, agent or employee is authorized  to make any amendment to this Agreement. This Agreement supersedes any and all prior  agreements, discussions and negotiations between you and Mobivity, and it sets  forth the entire agreement and understandings between the parties as to the subject  matter of this Agreement. Neither of the parties shall be bound by any terms, conditions,  definitions, waivers, warranties or representations with respect to the subject  matter of this Agreement other than as expressly provided in this Agreement or duly  set forth on or subsequent to the date hereof in a writing signed by a proper and  duly authorized representative of whichever of the parties is to be bound thereby.</li>
					<li>If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court  of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law that provision will be enforced  to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions of this Agreement  will remain in full force and effect.</li>
					<li>“Mobivity” and other trademarks contained in the Content  are trademarks or registered trademarks of Mobivity, Inc, in the United States  and/or other countries. Third party trademarks, trade names, product names and logos  may be the trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective owners. You may  not remove or alter any trademark, trade names, product names, logo, copyright or  other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in the Content.
